Choose your opponent carefully. 

You want to be a hero in your own life. Heros fight. And they fight with strong opponents.

You are in a state of being. An anomoly occurs. You allow it to demolish you. And then you rebuild. That's the highest end of moral hierarchy.

You have to go the highest resolution you can.
