Only a little part of the world is relevant to our life. 

Take your favorite room at home as an example. It is filled with light waves, visible and invisible, from infra-red to untra-vielet. In addition, there are also radio waves, natural radiations, and X-rays from the galaxy. But we only have a pair of detectors, each about 2-8 milimiters in diameter, to sense visible light spectrum. It is true that we only perceive a tiny fracton of electromagnetic fields filled in the room.

To nature, this tiny fraction of the world's information is exactly what we need to survive and reproduce, or that's the best evolution can do.


This means that the more we learn the more ignorance we discover about ourselves. This also mean everyone makes mistakes no matter how.

This also mean that you can't fall in love with your most reliable theories no matter how much rationality it contains. Instead, you have to always allow room for updates.

The best way to update existing theory is, in my estimation, to learn from exceptions. To note your error, articulate them, and strive to fix.
