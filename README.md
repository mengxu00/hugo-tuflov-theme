# Hugo Tuflove Theme

Edward Tufte uses a distinctive style in his handouts: simple, with well-set typography, extensive sidenotes, and tight integration of graphics and charts. This project brings Tufte style to Hugo with responsive navigation bars.

This project is directly inspired by and based on

* [Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) - The Tufte style sheet for HTML documents
* [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) - A CSS framework with simple and beautiful navigation bars
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - The content management framework used

## Why you need a theme for writing
Wrting is a process of formulating coherent ideas. A good content management system decouples the writing process into two parts: content generation, and formating. This separation allows you to focus on content quality.

Format matters because contents need to be coded, in HTML for example, in order to be readible. 

Publishing your writings on the web is a great way to share ideas. In order to let people and yourself to read effectively, you need to publish in HTML format, which can be interpreted and presented by web browsers. So ideally you will be able to write in plain text or markdown and leave the HTML generation task to a content management system.

Content management system does two things, formating and indexing. 

There are hundreds of 

## How this template is built
This tutorial will show how to creat a simple theme in Hugo. The initial goals are very simple

* To make a blog template which supports Tufte style sidenotes.
* To add navigation bars to organize categories and topic groups.
* To automatically generate article indeces. 

I assume you are familliar with HTML, CSS, and Markdown. I'll mainly explain how templates serve as dynamic content processors in Hugo, and how to organize templates to form a theme.

## install Hugo
I'm a Mac user. So I'll use Homebrew to install Hugo. if you are using Window, Linux, or BSD operating systems, please refer to Hugo installation documents. Overall a quite easy step.

```
$ brew install hugo
$ hugo version
Hugo Static Site Generator v0.52/extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate: unknown
```

That's it. Hugo installation completed. 

## Create a new site
Let's use Hugo to create a new site. I creat mine in my project folder. 

```
$ hugo new site exampleSite
Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in /Users/mxu/Projects/Writing/hugo-tuflove-theme/exampleSite.

Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
   Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/, or
   create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.
2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
   with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>/<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.

$ ls -l exampleSite/

drwxr-xr-x  3 mxu  staff  96 Apr 13 23:05 archetypes
-rw-r--r--  1 mxu  staff  82 Apr 13 23:05 config.toml

```

The content/ directory is used to store markdown format posts. It is empty for a new site.
The other directories are used when costomizing a theme. Please ignore them for now.

## Create new posts
Hugo has a command to generate a skeleton post. 

```
$ cd exampleSite/
$ hugo --verbose new post/first.md
INFO 2019/04/14 22:49:30 No translation bundle found for default language "en"
INFO 2019/04/14 22:49:30 Translation func for language en not found, use default.
INFO 2019/04/14 22:49:30 i18n not initialized; if you need string translations, check that you have a bundle in /i18n that matches the site language or the default language.
INFO 2019/04/14 22:49:30 Using config file: /Users/mxu/Projects/Writing/hugo-tuflove-theme/exampleSite/config.toml
INFO 2019/04/14 22:49:30 attempting to create "post/first.md" of "post" of ext ".md"
/Users/mxu/Projects/Writing/hugo-tuflove-theme/exampleSite/content/post/first.md created
```

Now we have created the first article named first.md in the post folder.
```
$ cat content/post/first.md
---
title: "First"
date: 2019-04-14T22:49:30-07:00
draft: true
---
```

## Generate HTML from Markdown for the new site
Running the `hugo` command with no options will read all the available content and thanslate them into HTML files. It will also copy everything that's not content to proper locations. 
```
hugo --verbose

The `--verbose` flag gives extra information that will be helpful when we build the template. Every line of the output that start with "INFO" or "WARN" is bpresent because we used that flag.

This command also generated a new public/ directory. Hugo copied all generated content there. 
```
$ ls -l public

drwxr-xr-x  3 mxu  staff   96 Apr 14 22:56 tags

Hugo generated two xml files and two folders, but there is no HTML files.

Connet to the listed URL (http://localhost:1313/). You might see a blank page sicnce there's no HTML file in public/ folder. To veryfy the built-in web server, you can manually add "index.xml" or "sitemap.xml" to the URL. For example, http://localhost:1313/index.xml or http://localhost:1313/sitemap.xml should show content of these two xml files.


## Create a new theme
Hugo doesn't come with a default theme. We are going the create a new theme called tuflove (Tufte theme for Hugo lovers).

### Create a skeleton
```
$ hugo new theme tuflove
Creating theme at /Users/mxu/Projects/Writing/hugo-tuflove-theme/exampleSite/themes/tuflove

$ find themes -type f | xargs ls -l
-rw-r--r--  1 mxu  staff  1081 May 27 22:03 themes/tuflove/LICENSE
-rw-r--r--  1 mxu  staff     8 May 27 22:03 themes/tuflove/archetypes/default.md

-rw-r--r--  1 mxu  staff     0 May 27 22:03 themes/tuflove/layouts/partials/footer.html
-rw-r--r--  1 mxu  staff     0 May 27 22:03 themes/tuflove/layouts/partials/head.html
-rw-r--r--  1 mxu  staff     0 May 27 22:03 themes/tuflove/layouts/partials/header.html
-rw-r--r--  1 mxu  staff   433 May 27 22:03 themes/tuflove/theme.toml
```

This skeleton includes templates (files ending in.html), license file, a description of your theme (theme.toml), and an empty archetype. Filling out he themoe.toml and LISENCE.md is optional. But it would be nice to declare them if you would like to distribute your theme.

Note that templete files at this skeleton stage are still empty. But we will change that and make them beautiful shortly.

### Update the Configure file to use the theme



## Create a static homepage

## Add content to the homepage

## Add content to the posts

## Creat a post listing

## Create top level pages


## Create the Header and Footer Partials

## Update the Home Page Template to Use the Partials

## Update the Default Single Template to Use the Partials

## Add “Date Published” to Posts and template
