# Hugo Tuflove Theme

Edward Tufte uses a distinctive style in his handouts: simple, with well-set typography, extensive sidenotes, and tight integration of graphics and charts. This project brings Tufte style theme with navigation bars to Hugo.

This project is directly inspired by and based on

* [Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) - The Tufte style sheet for HTML documents
* [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) - A CSS framework with simple and beautiful navigation bars
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - The content management framework used
