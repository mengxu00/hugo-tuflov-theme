# Hugo Tuflove Theme

Edward Tufte uses a distinctive style in his handouts: simple, with well-set typography, extensive sidenotes, and tight integration of graphics and charts. This project brings Tufte style to Hugo with responsive navigation bars.

This project is directly inspired by and based on

* [Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) - The Tufte style sheet for HTML documents
* [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/) - A CSS framework with simple and beautiful navigation bars
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) - The content management framework used

## Why you need a theme for writing
Wrting is a process of formulating coherent ideas. A good content management system decouples the writing process into two parts: content generation, and formating. This separation allows you to focus on content quality.

Format matters because contents need to be coded, in HTML for example, in order to be readible. 

Publishing your writings on the web is a great way to share ideas. In order to let people and yourself to read effectively, you need to publish in HTML format, which can be interpreted and presented by web browsers. So ideally you will be able to write in plain text or markdown and leave the HTML generation task to a content management system.

Content management system does two things, formating and indexing. 

There are hundreds of 

## How this template is built
This tutorial will show how to creat a simple theme in Hugo. The initial goals are very simple

* To make a blog template which supports Tufte style sidenotes.
* To add navigation bars to organize categories and topic groups.
* To automatically generate article indeces. 

I assume you are familliar with HTML, CSS, and Markdown. I'll mainly explain how templates serve as dynamic content processors in Hugo, and how to organize templates to form a theme.

## install Hugo
I'm a Mac user. So I'll use Homebrew to install Hugo. if you are using Window, Linux, or BSD operating systems, please refer to Hugo installation documents. Overall a quite easy step.

```
$ brew install hugo
$ hugo version
Hugo Static Site Generator v0.52/extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate: unknown
```

That's it. Hugo installation completed. 

## Create a new site
Let's use Hugo to create a new site. I creat mine in my project folder. 

```
$ hugo new site exampleSite
Congratulations! Your new Hugo site is created in /Users/mxu/Projects/Writing/hugo-tuflove-theme/exampleSite.

Just a few more steps and you're ready to go:

1. Download a theme into the same-named folder.
   Choose a theme from https://themes.gohugo.io/, or
   create your own with the "hugo new theme <THEMENAME>" command.
2. Perhaps you want to add some content. You can add single files
   with "hugo new <SECTIONNAME>/<FILENAME>.<FORMAT>".
3. Start the built-in live server via "hugo server".

Visit https://gohugo.io/ for quickstart guide and full documentation.

$ ls -l exampleSite/

```

The content/ directory is used to store markdown format posts. It is empty for a new site.
The other directories are used when costomizing a theme. Please ignore them for now.

## Create new posts
Hugo has a command to generate a skeleton post. 

```
$ cd exampleSite/
$ hugo --verbose new post/first.md
INFO 2019/04/14 22:49:30 No translation bundle found for default language "en"
INFO 2019/04/14 22:49:30 Translation func for language en not found, use default.
INFO 2019/04/14 22:49:30 i18n not initialized; if you need string translations, check that you have a bundle in /i18n that matches the site language or the default language.
INFO 2019/04/14 22:49:30 Using config file: /Users/mxu/Projects/Writing/hugo-tuflove-theme/exampleSite/config.toml

/Users/mxu/Projects/Writing/hugo-tuflove-theme/exampleSite/content/post/first.md created
```

Now we have created the first article named first.md in the post folder.
```
$ cat content/post/first.md
---
title: "First"
date: 2019-04-14T22:49:30-07:00
draft: true
---
```

## Generate HTML from Markdown for the new site
Running the `hugo` command with no options will read all the available content and thanslate them into HTML files. It will also copy everything that's not content to proper locations. 
```
hugo --verbose

The `--verbose` flag gives extra information that will be helpful when we build the template. Every line of the output that start with "INFO" or "WARN" is bpresent because we used that flag.

This command also generated a new public/ directory. Hugo copied all generated content there. 
```
$ ls -l public

Hugo generated two xml files and two folders, but there is no HTML files.

For example, http://localhost:1313/index.xml or http://localhost:1313/sitemap.xml should show content of these two xml files.


## Create a new theme
Hugo doesn't come with a default theme. We are going the create a new theme called tuflove (Tufte theme for Hugo lovers).

### Create a skeleton
```
$ hugo new theme tuflov
Creating theme at /Users/mxu/Projects/Writing/hugo-tuflove-theme/exampleSite/themes/tuflov

$ find themes -type f | xargs ls -l
-rw-r--r--  1 mxu  staff  1081 May 29 23:09 themes/tuflov/LICENSE
-rw-r--r--  1 mxu  staff     8 May 29 23:09 themes/tuflov/archetypes/default.md

-rw-r--r--  1 mxu  staff     0 May 29 23:09 themes/tuflov/layouts/_default/list.html
-rw-r--r--  1 mxu  staff     0 May 29 23:09 themes/tuflov/layouts/_default/single.html
-rw-r--r--  1 mxu  staff     0 May 29 23:09 themes/tuflov/layouts/index.html
-rw-r--r--  1 mxu  staff     0 May 29 23:09 themes/tuflov/layouts/partials/footer.html
-rw-r--r--  1 mxu  staff     0 May 29 23:09 themes/tuflov/layouts/partials/head.html
-rw-r--r--  1 mxu  staff     0 May 29 23:09 themes/tuflov/layouts/partials/header.html
-rw-r--r--  1 mxu  staff   432 May 29 23:09 themes/tuflov/theme.toml
```

This skeleton includes templates (files ending in.html), license file, a description of your theme (theme.toml), and an empty archetype. Filling out he themoe.toml and LISENCE.md is optional. But it would be nice to declare them if you would like to distribute your theme.

Note that templete files at this skeleton stage are still empty. But we will change that and make them beautiful shortly.

### Update the Configure file to use the theme
Now that we have a theme to test with. It is a good idea to add the theme name to the configuration file. An alter native way is to add "-t tuflov" to explicitely specify theme in command line. 

```
$ vi config.toml

theme = "tuflov"
baseURL = ""
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "tuflov - Tufte for Hugo lovers"
```

### Gererate the site with the skeleton theme
Now let's generatethe site again with the empty theme
```
$ hugo --verbose
INFO 2019/05/29 23:17:03 No translation bundle found for default language "en"

### Content vs. static
Hugo does two things when generating the site. It uses templates to transform content into HTML and it copies static files into the site. Unlike content, static files are not transformed. They are copied exactly as they are.

Hugo assumes that your site will use both CSS and JavaScript, so it creates directories in your theme to hold them. Remember opinions? Well, Hugo's opinion is that you'll store your CSS in a directory named css/ and your JavaScript in a directory named js/. If you don't like that, you can change the directory names in your theme directory or even delete them completely. Hugo's nice enough to offer its opinion, then behave nicely if you disagree.
```
$ find themes/tuflov -type d | xargs ls -ld
drwxr-xr-x  7 mxu  staff  224 May 29 23:14 themes/tuflov

drwxr-xr-x  2 mxu  staff   64 May 29 23:14 themes/tuflov/static/js
```

## Theme development cycle
When you're developing a theme, you will make changes (in the theme dir), rebuild the site, and check your chages (in the browser).
1. Purge he the Public/ directory.
2. Run the build in web server in watch mode.
3. review your site in a browser.
4. Update theme.
5. Return to step 3.

## Theme development commands
Use the following commands as the basis of your workflow
```
# purger old public, static files
$ rm -rf public

# run hugo in watch mode
$ hugo server --watch --verbose

```

## Create a static homepage
Right now, there is no homepage yet. Hogo server will look for one of three files inthe the them's layout/ directory
1. index.html
2. \_default/list.html
3. \_default/single.html

We could update one tof the default template, but a good design decision is to update the *most specific* template available. That is not a hard and fast rule, but it is a good generalization.

Right now, that page is empty because we don;t have an content or any logic in the template. Let's change that by adding some text to the template.
```
$ vi themes/tuflov/layouts/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html> 
<html> 
<body> 
  <p>hugo says hello!</p> 
</body> 
</html> 
:wq

$
```
Build the web site and you'll be able to see a index.html being created under the public/ directory. Note that if you are running the server with the --watch option, the file may not be created. But you'll be able to see the change in a browser.

## Add content to the posts
Creating a static home page is a successful start point. Now let's create some content to the site. We'll display posts as a list on the home page and on their own page, too.

Hugo has a command to generate a skeleton post, just like it does for sites and themes.
```
$ hugo --verbose new post/first.md

INFO 2019/06/06 20:09:08 No translation bundle found for default language "en"

```

---
title: "First"
date: 2019-06-06T20:09:08-07:00
draft: true
---
```

Hogo uses an archetype to create the post file. We can create an archetype file specifically for the post type
```
$ vi themes/tuflov/archetypes/post.md

---
Description: ""
Tags: []
Categories: []
draft: true
---
:wq

$ cat content/post/first.md
---
title: "First"
date: 2019-06-06T20:09:08-07:00
draft: true
---

```

Hugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every content file. Hugo will first look for a template ile that matches the section or type name. If it can't find one, then it will look in the \_default/ directory. For now we can assume that Hugo will try posts/single.html, them \_defult/single.html
```
$ find themes/tuflov/ -name single.html | xargs ls -l
-rw-r--r--  1 mxu  staff  0 May 29 23:14 themes/tuflov//layouts/_default/single.html
```

We could create a new template, /posts/single.html, or change the default. 

Let's start with updating the default. It is good to start here because we can stat to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types we'll frfactor this file and move logic around. 

### update the tempalte file
```
$ vi themes/tuflov//layouts/_default/single.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>{{ .Title }}</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>{{ .Title }}</h1>
  {{ .Content }}
</body>
</html>
:wq
```

Build the web site and verify the results.

Notice that the posts now have content. You can go to localhost:1313/posts/first/ to verify.




## Add content to the homepage
The home page will contain a list of posts. Let's update its template to add the posts that we just created.
```
$ vi themes/tuflov/layouts/index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
  <p>hugo says hello!</p>
  {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }}
    <h1>{{ .Title }}</h1>
  {{ end }}
</body>
</html>
:wq
```

Hugo uses the Go template engine. That engine scans the template files for commands which ar enclosed between "{{" and "}}". In this template ,the commands are:
1. range
2. .Title
3. end
The "range" command is an iterator. We use it to loop through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that ugo createds is trated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.

The ".Title" command print the value to the "title" variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.

The "end" command signals the ened of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds "end"

Build the web site and then veryfy the resutls.
```
